## 🎵 Music & Mental Health: Analyzing the Impact of Music Therapy  

### 📌 About This Project  
This study explores how **music therapy** influences mental health by analyzing user listening behaviors, genre preferences, and therapy outcomes. Using **statistical analysis, clustering, and hypothesis testing**, we identify trends that provide insights for firms looking to optimize music-based interventions.  

### 🔍 Research Focus  
✔ **Segmentation of music therapy users** using **K-Means clustering**  
✔ **Impact of music genres** on mental health conditions (Anxiety, Depression, OCD, Insomnia)  
✔ **Listening frequency analysis** – Does daily listening improve well-being?  
✔ **Music tempo and its effects** on relaxation and stress management  
✔ **Musician vs. Non-Musician effects** on mental health improvement  
✔ **Exploratory listening habits** and their role in emotional well-being  
✔ **Listening to music while working** – Does it reduce stress?  

### 📊 Methodology  
🔹 **Dataset** – Survey data (736 responses) categorized by **personal info, music habits, and mental health scores**  
🔹 **Clustering Analysis** – K-Means used to segment therapy users  
🔹 **Statistical Testing** – T-tests, Chi-square, and logistic regression to determine significant relationships  
🔹 **Data Visualization** – Boxplots, bar charts, and facet grids to uncover trends  

### 💡 Key Findings  
🎧 **Frequent music listening does not necessarily improve mental health** – It may be a coping mechanism rather than a solution.  
🎵 **Certain genres (Gospel, Classical, Folk, Rock) show positive mental health effects**, while others (Metal, Video Game Music) correlate with higher distress.  
🚀 **Exploring new music is linked to better mental well-being**, especially in younger listeners.  
🎼 **Musicians report more significant mental health improvements compared to non-musicians.**  
💼 **Listening to music while working is associated with stress reduction**, particularly for OCD symptoms.  

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Statistical Analysis** (T-tests, Logistic Regression, Clustering)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
